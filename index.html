        <h3><strong>About India-</strong></h3>
        <p id="india-land">India's landscapes are as <em><strong>fantastically</strong></em> varied as its cultural traditions. From the snow-dusted peaks of the Himalayas to the sun-splashed beaches
        of the tropical south, the country has a <em><strong>bounty</strong></em> of outdoor attractions. You can scout for big jungle cats on scenic wildlife safaris, paddle in the shimmering waters
        of coastal retreats, take blood-pumping treks high in the mountains, or simply inhale pine-scented air on meditative forest walks. Among all these natural treasures is a wealth of architectural
        <em><strong>gems</strong></em>, from serene temples rising out of pancake-flat plains to crumbling forts peering over plunging ravines.</p>

        <h4>Indian cuisines-</h4>
        <p id="india-cuisines">Indian cuisine is a <strong><em>scrumptious smorgasbord</em></strong> of regionally distinct recipes, each with their own traditional preparation techniques and presentation
        styles – from the competing flavours of masterfully marinated meats and <em>thalis</em> (plate meals) to the simple splendour of vegetarian curries and deep-sea delights. Spices lie at the heart of
        Indian cooking, with the crackle of cumin seeds in hot oil a familiar sound in most kitchens. The country is also renowned for its tempting array of street food, with vendors selling everything from
        spicy <em>samosas</em> and kebabs to cooling <em>kulfi</em> (ice cream) and lassi (yoghurt drink).</p>

        <ul id="places">Places to visit in India:
        <p>                                       </p>
        <li class="states">Kerala</li>
        <p>The southwestern state of India known as Kerala is a place of tropical beauty. Palm trees, white sand beaches and eco-tourism are all big reasons to explore the region. Besides its famous
        backwaters, elegant houseboats and temple festivals, Kerala is also home to Thekkady, a tiger preserve which allows you to admire flora and fauna without crowds. The hub of Kerala is the city
        of Kochi, where you can see the local fishing industry thriving along with modern high-rises and colonial architecture. Kochi is ethnically and religiously diverse, and in a single afternoon 
        you can explore a Jewish synagogue, a Dutch palace, the Portuguese Pallipuram Fort and the Hindu Thrikkakara Temple.</p>
        <li class="states">Agra</li>
        <p>Agra is one of the most-visited cities in all of India. Once the capital of the Mughal Empire, Agra is now home to the iconic structure known as the Taj Mahal. The white marble mausoleum was
        built in the 17th century, and it is widely regarded as a monument of love. While spectacularly beautiful, the Taj Majal can be very crowded. Also worth seeing in Agra is the Agra Fort,
        which is very similar to the Red Fort of Delhi. You can tour this 16th century fort and even explore the interior of its beautiful palace.</p>
        <li class="states">Rajasthan</li>
        <p>Northwest India is where you’ll find the state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan and is home to the Thar Desert. Whether you’re interested in Rajput history or views of the Aravallis
        Mountains, Rajasthan contains some of the best places to visit in India. Jaipur, or the Pink City, is the capital of Rajasthan and a wonderful place to begin your trip. It is home to an array
        of incredible architecture, including three forts, many temples and the extraordinary City Palace. Also in Rajasthan and worth visiting is Jodhpur, the so-called Blue City that is the gateway
        to the Thar Desert as well as the home to the spectacular Mehrangarh Fort.</p>
        <li class="states">Varanasi</li>
        <p>With a history dating back to more than 3,000 years, Varanasi is one of the world’s oldest living cities. Located in North India on the banks of the River Ganges, Varanasi has been an important 
        center of learning for ages as well as a chief pilgrimage destination for many Hindus. Varanasi is regarded as a sacred city among Hindus, Jains and Buddhists because it is believed that dying 
        here releases a person’s soul from the cycle of reincarnation, and that bathing in the River Ganges cleanses one’s sins. Varanasi offers sights and experiences unknown anywhere else in the world.
        It is nicknamed the “City of Temples” because of its thousands of temples. Some of the most significant are the Kashi Vishwanath Temple of Shiva, the Durga Temple and the Sankat Mochan Hanuman
        Temple, which is known for housing numerous monkeys.Probably the most famous sites of the city are the ghats, the series of embankment steps leading down to the Ganges River, where many people 
        gather to bathe. The oldest and main ghat is the Dashashwamedh Ghat. The Manikarnika Ghat is a burning ghat where Hindu cremations and rituals of death anniversaries are frequently held. Yoga,
        shaves and massages are other activities available here. The best way to see the ghats is by taking a morning boat ride at sunrise. Silk weaving is popular in Varanasi, and there are scores of shops and markets selling silk products like sarees and scarves in addition to other handicrafts.</p>

         <ul id="monument">Monuments to see in India:
        <p>                                       </p>
        <li class="monuments">Taj Mahal</li>
        <p>The Taj Mahal is more than just a mausoleum - it is has been described by the poet Rabindranath Tagore as a "teardrop on the cheek of eternity". As an expression of the height of the Mughal
        dynasty's architectural genius in the Indian subcontinent, as the symbol of a bereaved emperor's love for his empress, and as an inspiration to countless photographers and artists who have tried to
        capture its many subtle nuances of light and shade, the Taj Mahal continues to captivate people worldwide with its history, its design, and its symbolism of eternal love.</p>
        <li class="monuments">Qutub Minar</li>
        <p>The Qutub Minar is the tallest brick minaret in the world. Built exclusively in red brick and sandstone this minaret in Delhi is an exquisite example of Indo-Islamic Afghan architecture.
        Today, Qutub Minar is an eminent member of the World Heritage Site community and has managed to stand firm despite the ravages of time. Qutub Minar of Delhi is surrounded by a lush green manicured 
        garden, which is a much favored leisure spot for Delhi locals. You can see tourists and locals loitering around the whole winter afternoons here and there inside the tower.</p>
        <li class="monuments">Sanchi Stupa</li>
        <p>Ashoka the Mauryan emperor was the initiator of all the "Stupas" at Sanchi. These Stupas are a tribute to Lord Buddha. Of all the stupas, the Sanchi Stupa is the most important and impressive
        Stupa carved out of a semi-circular rock. This great monument has been built to enshrine the relics of Lord Buddha. Sanchi is one of the famed places that are not only recognized in India but 
        across the world. Today, this place has become a legendary hub of Buddhism.</p>
        <li class="monuments">Gateway of india</li>
        <p>The Gateway of India was built in 1924 to celebrate the arrival of King George V and Queen Mary. The design and the plan was given by George Wittet which was approved by the then Governor 
        General of Mumbai, Sir George Sydenham Clarke. The construction began in 1911 and took thirteen years for the entire project to be completed. The Gateway of India was inaugurated by the Viceroy, 
        the Earl of Reading on 4th December, 1924. The Gateway of India became all the more symbolic when the last British Force left our country on 28th February 1948.></p>
